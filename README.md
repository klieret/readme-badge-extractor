ðŸ‘· **This project is currently in early development** ðŸ‘·

This repository provides

* a script to read a readme like this one and extract all badges from it returned
  as a data object containing target url, image url and image alt text. This
  is similar to the objective of the [node-detect-readme-badges](https://github.com/IndigoUnited/node-detect-readme-badges)
  project
* a script that that includes badges from certain repositories into a HTML file,
  for example to create overview pages like [mine](https://lieret.net/opensource)
